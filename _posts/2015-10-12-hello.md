Hello people of the internet! I'm your host, PK! If you are on this webpage, you either are a friend who I mentioned this to, a person who typed in a wrong link and got here, or a web crawler. Either ways, hi! This is my first post on this blog-esque thing, and it is probably going to be an introductory post on what is going to be posted here. So here goes. On this page, you would find my adventures in programming, life rants, all types of reviews, and epiphany moments.

That is just a short outlook on what would be featured here, so the only way to find out more is to stay tuned (eventhough it isn't a channel/video)! Anyways, I'll see you soon!
