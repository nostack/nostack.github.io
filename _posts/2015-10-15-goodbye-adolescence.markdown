This past weekend, something changed in my views of who I am. It all started when I went to the mall to buy a couple jackets for myself. I went to the GAP, and I couldn't really find anything in the kids section, the place I had shopped at for so long due to my height and body structure. I am quite thin, and am also relatively small for my age. So I decided to look in the men's section, a place where the sizes never fit me. I tried on the extra small, and it fit me! I felt so glad, as I always wanted to shop in the men's section for its better variety and choices. I bought the jackets I liked, and when I got home I didn't feel like an adolescent any more. Believe it or not, I felt a lot more mature. This shows how the tiniest change to attire can change the way you think about yourself and act with others. That's my story, hope you have gone through something like this as well!
