Recently, I went for the movie Spectre with one of my good friends. Spectre is your classic James Bond movie, with girls, action, and your classic villain. However, with Spectre, there's a twist. I won't expain the twist, as it makes this post suspectible to spoliers, but I'll say that the villain, or "organization", was originally introduced in Dr. No, the first James Bond movie. This reveals the sense of countuity throughout all the James Bond movies, as there is also a villain that is prominent in addition to the hero.  The movie was quite nostalgic for me, as I felt I hadn't watched a James Bond movie for ages, when realllyit had been less than two years. Growing up, most people would have watched Dora, or shows similar to that. With me however, Star Wars and James Bond was my childhood. I loved those classic car chases like the one in DIe Another Day, with James Bond in the classic Aston Martin.

Moving on to the actual movie, which was quite good. However, the one part I wish that was better were the expressions of Daniel Craig. He, by nature, is very expressionless, always being quite serious. It ruins the experience, as even during the romantic parts he seems like he is fighting a war.
