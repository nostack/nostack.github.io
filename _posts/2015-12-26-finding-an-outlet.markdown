So recently, about 2 months ago, I mentioned that I had quit Dota 2 and switched to doing more productive things, specifically code-related work. I have an update on that, however it needs a bit of a preface. Everyone in this world of ours gets angry from time, whether it be at a person, at the world, or even at yourself. However, not many people can simply bottle up that anger and hide it deep within themselves, and those who can still have trouble with it. It's not just anger, it can be any emotion such as sadness, frustration, fear, etc. The important thing is that you find a way to release this emotion, or rather find an outlet to deal with it.

According to dictionary.com, an outlet is "a means of expression or satisfaction". It basically is a way to express yourself, and in this case it is a way to deal with your emotions. As a teenager, I have to deal with my emotions often, as I'm in that stage where my emotions are all over the place. For some people, their outlet is writing, or perhaps playing sports, or even simply talking to someone. I guess this blog is an outlet in a way, because I'm expressing my emotions and thoughts to the reader. These past few months, my emotions have been crazier than ever. I get annoyed at the smallest of things, from a simple thing like my parents telling me get off my pc, to a insignificant thing like losing a mark on my test. 

Yesterday I had an epiphany. Ever since I reduced my gaming time, I've been facing this more and more. Don't get me wrong, Dota 2 only aggravated my emotions. However, recently I've been increasing my playtime of games like Maplestory and other MMORPGs. Playing as a character, one that you designed, is pretty awesome for getting away from the chaos happening inside yourself. It's like reading a book, getting completely losing yourself inside it, losing touch of reality and being completely engrossed inside it. Sure, gaming can be considered counter-productive to basically anything, but in regulation, it can really help you.

Now moving on to the exact games I play. As of this moment, I have about 100 games in my steam library, 94 are my brother's which he shared with me, and the rest are mine. I've been playing a lot of Witcher 3 + CS:GO, and I really like it. This brings me to my next point - the future of this blog. At the moment, I'm trying to get an audio version of this blog setup - a way that readers can choose to listen to the post (me talking) or read it themselves. I also want to start doing more reviews, specifically movies, games, and even books from time to time.

In summary, find an outlet. Do something to release all those built up emotions inside you, don't ignore them. Until next time - au revoir!
