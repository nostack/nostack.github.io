        Spectre - Movie Experience
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>Recently, I went for the movie Spectre with one of my good friends. Spectre is your classic James Bond movie, with girls, action, and your classic villain. However, with Spectre, there&#39;s a twist. I won&#39;t expain the twist, as it makes this post suspectible to spoliers, but I&#39;ll say that the villain, or &quot;organization&quot;, was originally introduced in Dr. No, the first James Bond movie. This reveals the sense of countuity throughout all the James Bond movies, as there is also a villain that is prominent in addition to the hero.  The movie was quite nostalgic for me, as I felt I hadn&#39;t watched a James Bond movie for ages, when realllyit had been less than two years. Growing up, most people would have watched Dora, or shows similar to that. With me however, Star Wars and James Bond was my childhood. I loved those classic car chases like the one in DIe Another Day, with James Bond in the classic Aston Martin.</p>

<p>Moving on to the actual movie, which was quite good. However, the one part I wish that was better were the expressions of Daniel Craig. He, by nature, is very expressionless, always being quite serious. It ruins the experience, as even during the romantic parts he seems like he is fighting a war. </p>

        Coding Monopoly?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>Recently, I got back into programming, as mentioned in my last post. Although I like programming in python, I sometimes, well often, feel the restraints of python as a language, especially when it comes to defining variables and setting datatypes. For those don&#39;t understand what I mean, python dynamically sets the data types of variables, lists, subprograms, etc. Additionally, other languages like Java and C++ were designed with one specific purpose: Object-Oriented Programming. OOP isn&#39;t really possible in Python, and here started my journey to learn a new language.</p>

<p>Once I made the decision to learn a new language, I found myself at yet another crossroad. I had two choices, or rather two languages that I had to pick from to learn; Java and C++. I had learnt C++ back when I was in grade 7 or 8, and it&#39;s one of the languages whose syntax is quite easy to forget. However, I did recognize pieces of it, as a good friend of mine programs mostly in C++, in addition to Python. I finally made the decision to try something new, something different than what I was used to, Java. I currently am taking grade 11 computer science in high school, although I am in grade 10, and I often regret the fact that I didn&#39;t take grade 12, as I find the topics we learn too easy at times. Java is taught to the grade 12&#39;s, so I figured it would only be fitting to learn Java.</p>

<p>I started to learn Java, and found that the syntax was surprisingly similar, and almost instantly got to advanced topics like OOP, as most of the logical reasoning and syntax were quite easy to pick up, thanks to both the course I was taking as well as my previous endevours in C++. So once I started learning OOP, I decided I need a challenge, something to program as a way of demonstrating my newfound knowledge. I couldn&#39;t think of anything at that moment, so I decided to sleep on it, and perhaps decide the next day. At school, a friend of mine (as you can see friends often inspire me) actually told me that he was programming a monopoly game using OOP!</p>

<p>This is the place where I got an idea, a wonderful idea (in my opinion). I figured that it would be fun for him and I to code the program seperately, the same one, and then reconvene and see how each one did it, and how differently. So I started programming, using a seperate class for the people in the game, and within that having methods for a turn, such as rolling a dice and buying/selling properties, etc. This is where I ran into my first problem, how to actually store all the information of the spaces, or each property/airport/wildcard etc. Do I use a text file to import my data from, use arrays, how? I am yet to find a solution to this problem, and I probably will, but for now the project is on a full stop until I get through this week of school, as I have tests upon tests, mid term practicals and quizzes, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep you guys or gals, updated on both my solution, as well as future problems and interesting endevours I have. Until then, sayonara!</p>

        From Dota 2 to Python 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>When I was in grade 8, I stumbled upon a game called Dota 2. At the time, I didn&#39;t know what it was, or what the game was about, but I was excited to try the game that I had heard so much about. For those who don&#39;t know what Dota 2 is, it is basically a game in which you defend towers, but attack the other team&#39;s towers, eventually reaching the heart of their base, their ancient. It is a game similar to League of Legends, and it a real time strategy game, an RTS. However, this game in paticular is a lot harder than others (although this is up for debate), but is also quite addictive.</p>

<p>So in the summer of grade 8, I started to play this game with a friend of mine. We played every day pretty much, having fun, even though we died constantly and were terrible at the game. At one point however, we started to get better and learn from our mistakes. We watched the professionals play and we started to improve, but this is where things started to go downhill. We started to get annoyed at others, because they made the same mistakes we did when we started, but instead they were much more &quot;salty&quot;, rather aggravating. Every two seconds I would find myself saying &quot;Oh mon dieux&quot; or something worse along those lines. Come grade 9, we continued to play this game, with newly found friends and new strategies.</p>

<p>However at one point, it got too much for my friend and I. We quit Dota 2 for a while, for about a stretch of 3 months, just until after exams. We found ourselves feeling much better every day, not getting annoyed at people, coding more, etc. I found myself playing other games, like Maplestory, Planetside 2, etc. At the time, gaming was my outlet, where I could let go of all my built up emotions and just be someone else entierly.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the summer of grade 9, and I found myself at a crossroad. I liked playing Dota, but I also found myself hating it at times. My choice was to either stop playing Dota to find myself eventually coming back to it, or continue playing it and not do anything productive. If you know me, you know I don&#39;t like two choices. I made a third choice, and I gave up gaming entierly, for the most part at least. I started learning HTML and CSS, using the command line (which is what is used to run this blog), as well as learning other languages and being more productive.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s my point in all this? Am I trying to say gaming is bad? No, actually it is the opposite. What I&#39;m trying to say is always reflect on what you are doing, and make sure you are doing the thing that you truly wish you could be doing. I know this may sound, cheesy, and I often make things cheesy, but I&#39;m dead serious. Even today, I rarely play video games, apart from the occasional jump on Maplestory maybe 3 times a week for about a half hour, from my 2 hour gaming sessions of Dota 2 every day. I now make time to write this blog, work on problems for Computer Science, etc. So that&#39;s it for this rant about my life and how gaming affected it, but I hope you took something from this, or if you didn&#39;t, I hope you learned something about me from this.  </p>

        Goodbye Adolescence?

    <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>This past weekend, something changed in my views of who I am. It all started when I went to the mall to buy a couple jackets for myself. I went to the GAP, and I couldn&#39;t really find anything in the kids section, the place I had shopped at for so long due to my height and body structure. I am quite thin, and am also relatively small for my age. So I decided to look in the men&#39;s section, a place where the sizes never fit me. I tried on the extra small, and it fit me! I felt so glad, as I always wanted to shop in the men&#39;s section for its better variety and choices. I bought the jackets I liked, and when I got home I didn&#39;t feel like an adolescent any more. Believe it or not, I felt a lot more mature. This shows how the tiniest change to attire can change the way you think about yourself and act with others. That&#39;s my story, hope you have gone through something like this as well!</p>

    <p>Hello people of the internet! I&#39;m your host, PK! If you are on this webpage, you either are a friend who I mentioned this to, a person who typed in a wrong link and got here, or a web crawler. Either ways, hi! This is my first post on this blog-esque thing, and it is probably going to be an introductory post on what is going to be posted here. So here goes. On this page, you would find my adventures in programming, life rants, all types of reviews, and epiphany moments.</p>

<p>That is just a short outlook on what would be featured here, so the only way to find out more is to stay tuned (eventhough it isn&#39;t a channel/video)! Anyways, I&#39;ll see you soon!</p>
