      <p><p>Less than 24 hours ago, I finished what is in my opinion, the best designed game of all time. This game is Witcher 3. I've been working on finishing it since perhaps the end of December, and the sheer amount of detail and story put into it is amazing. I loved every second of the game, and I couldn't stop playing it. In fact, the ending was so beautiful that I ended up crying. So why exactly is it such a breathtaking game? It's a breathtaking game because of many factors, such as the immense amount of work put it to focus even on the smallest things, the beauty in the graphics, and lastly the mechanics of the game.</p>

      <p><p>Today is a very special day for a lot of people. It is February 27, 2016, exactly 20 years since the original release of the first Pokemon game. It is a very special day for me, as I grew up playing a lot of Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, and I couldn't get enough of it. Even today, I find myself choosing to play my 3DS over perhaps playing CS:GO on my laptop. Currently, I just finished a run of Omega Ruby, which as you can tell by the title, is a remake of the original Ruby made 10 years ago if I remember correctly.</p>

      <p><p>Alright, first off I'M SORRY :( I know I said would post about the new Star Wars movies but I never really did. It's been 1.5 months since I first watched the movie, and I think it's high time I do a formal-esque review. Let me start off with a bit of a background on when I watched the original movies. When I first watched them, I absolutely fell in love with them. I swung mop sticks around the house, made lightsaber noises with my house, and did everything a kid in love with Star Wars would do. I always found myself loving the whole Star Wars theme, and this is even prominent today. In fact, quite recently I spent about 50 hours editing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nJ55_RCwvw" title="Title">this video.</a></p>

      <p><p>Recently, I've been looking into setting up e-mail notifications for this blog (soon to come, I promise), and it's been difficult setting up a script to send out emails. I initially looked at sending email's through terminal using a service called postfix, but that went way above my head and I didn't know what was going on. I spend about 8 hours looking at a billion different ways to do this. Finally, after endless searching, I managed to do it. I ended up using python, and I was surprised on how easy it was. It took me ~10 minutes to set it up once I knew how to, much less than the amount of time I spend on trying to do it through terminal.</p>

      <p><p>So when I say the ultimate switch, what exactly do I mean? Most people growing up used to play with toys, or watch endless hours of Treehouse, or do something of the sort. My childhood was a lot different, partly because I grew up with a brother who was 8 years older than me. I always fancied the things he did, such as making powerpoint presentations, or playing Doom on the computer, etc. As soon as he used to finish up with the computer, I used to hop on it and do exactly what he did. Due to this, I grew up with computers. I always used Windows computers, as those were the ones we had around the house. So for about 10 years of my life (the time that I used computers), I was used to Windows PCs. But then, perhaps last month, I found out that my brother was going to switch jobs and join a startup. I was always envious of the things he had, especially his Macbook. I think you can see where this is going. When he told me that he would get a computer from his new job and wouldn't need his Mac, I was excited. He told me that I would get his Mac, and I was astonished. It was always my dream to get a unix machine, due to the sheer power of the OS. The beauty of the OS doesn't hurt either.</p>

      <p><p>So recently, about 2 months ago, I mentioned that I had quit Dota 2 and switched to doing more productive things, specifically code-related work. I have an update on that, however it needs a bit of a preface. Everyone in this world of ours gets angry from time, whether it be at a person, at the world, or even at yourself. However, not many people can simply bottle up that anger and hide it deep within themselves, and those who can still have trouble with it. It's not just anger, it can be any emotion such as sadness, frustration, fear, etc. The important thing is that you find a way to release this emotion, or rather find an outlet to deal with it.</p>

      <p><p>Recently, I went for the movie Spectre with one of my good friends. Spectre is your classic James Bond movie, with girls, action, and your classic villain. However, with Spectre, there's a twist. I won't expain the twist, as it makes this post suspectible to spoliers, but I'll say that the villain, or "organization", was originally introduced in Dr. No, the first James Bond movie. This reveals the sense of countuity throughout all the James Bond movies, as there is also a villain that is prominent in addition to the hero.  The movie was quite nostalgic for me, as I felt I hadn't watched a James Bond movie for ages, when realllyit had been less than two years. Growing up, most people would have watched Dora, or shows similar to that. With me however, Star Wars and James Bond was my childhood. I loved those classic car chases like the one in DIe Another Day, with James Bond in the classic Aston Martin.</p>

      <p><p>Recently, I got back into programming, as mentioned in my last post. Although I like programming in python, I sometimes, well often, feel the restraints of python as a language, especially when it comes to defining variables and setting datatypes. For those don't understand what I mean, python dynamically sets the data types of variables, lists, subprograms, etc. Additionally, other languages like Java and C++ were designed with one specific purpose: Object-Oriented Programming. OOP isn't really possible in Python, and here started my journey to learn a new language.</p>

      <p><p>When I was in grade 8, I stumbled upon a game called Dota 2. At the time, I didn't know what it was, or what the game was about, but I was excited to try the game that I had heard so much about. For those who don't know what Dota 2 is, it is basically a game in which you defend towers, but attack the other team's towers, eventually reaching the heart of their base, their ancient. It is a game similar to League of Legends, and it a real time strategy game, an RTS. However, this game in paticular is a lot harder than others (although this is up for debate), but is also quite addictive.</p>

      <p><p>This past weekend, something changed in my views of who I am. It all started when I went to the mall to buy a couple jackets for myself. I went to the GAP, and I couldn't really find anything in the kids section, the place I had shopped at for so long due to my height and body structure. I am quite thin, and am also relatively small for my age. So I decided to look in the men's section, a place where the sizes never fit me. I tried on the extra small, and it fit me! I felt so glad, as I always wanted to shop in the men's section for its better variety and choices. I bought the jackets I liked, and when I got home I didn't feel like an adolescent any more. Believe it or not, I felt a lot more mature. This shows how the tiniest change to attire can change the way you think about yourself and act with others. That's my story, hope you have gone through something like this as well!</p>
