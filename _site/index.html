      <p><p>Less than 24 hours ago, I finished what is in my opinion, the best designed game of all time. This game is Witcher 3. I've been working on finishing it since perhaps the end of December, and the sheer amount of detail and story put into it is amazing. I loved every second of the game, and I couldn't stop playing it. In fact, the ending was so beautiful that I ended up crying. So why exactly is it such a breathtaking game? It's a breathtaking game because of many factors, such as the immense amount of work put it to focus even on the smallest things, the beauty in the graphics, and lastly the mechanics of the game.</p>

<p>Let's start off with the work put in on the game. The game itself is said to provide a minimum of 50 hours on a quick run, but if one takes the time to explore everything it's closer to 200. In addition to this, CD Projekt Red (the creator of the game), focused on the smallest things, such as the signs the main character made when casting spells. Usually, if the game was played normally, in third person view, it would be impossible to actually see the signs that Geralt, the hero, makes with his fingers. However, if console commands are used to zoom in on the hands, the symbols can be seen. Just the fact that CDPR spent the time to program things that wouldn't even be possible in the regular game shows the amount of work they put in. If this wasn't enough, they also spent time on making a 100+ different character endings for characters (that is for side characters), completely based on the choices you make in the game. Although there are 3 main character endings, this is the first time a RPG has made a world where the main character's choices actually affects the prices of items in the world, how people act towards you, etc.</p>

<p>Let's move on to the beauty of the graphics, which are stunning. If my word isn't enough, look at the picture below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/witcher3screenie.jpg" alt="Sunset" /></p>

<p>Tell me, can you tell that it's a screenshot of a game? The combination of shaders and the detail of the actual environment make it such a breathtaking experience to play the game. In addition to this, just the simple details that were added to the game, like the armor you equipped during the game is shown in the cutscenes, something that never really happens in any other RPG. Having been a person who played Skyrim as his first real open world RPG, the Witcher 3 was a completely different take on this matter. Skyrim graphics were beautiful, at least for it's time, but the Witcher 3 is officially the best RPG ever made, and the awards it has won proves that.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the game probably even top the graphics. The combat system is so intricate that it's actually hard to pick up. On harder difficulties, regenerating health practically relies solely on potions and food. For the first time in a game, food actually serves a purpose, not just cosmetics. Speaking of cosmetics, CD Projekt Red did a great job with this as well. As you progress through the game, the main character slowly ages, and his beard grows due to this. This is something that never had been done before, and had only been done in Skyrim through the use of mods.</p>

<p>In the end, this game was an absolute joy to play through, and I'm currently in the process of playing through it again. That's it for this post (don't worry the audio will be out soon). Until next time - ciao!</p>

      <p><p>Today is a very special day for a lot of people. It is February 27, 2016, exactly 20 years since the original release of the first Pokemon game. It is a very special day for me, as I grew up playing a lot of Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, and I couldn't get enough of it. Even today, I find myself choosing to play my 3DS over perhaps playing CS:GO on my laptop. Currently, I just finished a run of Omega Ruby, which as you can tell by the title, is a remake of the original Ruby made 10 years ago if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>I first played Ruby when I was 7, and I couldn't stop playing it. I used to hide my Gameboy Advance under my pillow and secretly play under my blanket. I used to feel like such a rebel, doing things my parents told me not to. <em>Sighs</em>, those were the days. I vividly remember going into a flea market, looking for Pokemon Emerald, as I really wanted to play it, but it wasn't sold anymore. I bought it for something like 2$, and it probably sells for a whole lot more nowadays. Additionally, I remember always wanting to get a DS, dreaming about the day when I would get one. Unfortunately, I never had the pleasure of getting a DS, and only got a 3DS for my 15th birthday.</p>

<p>So lets fast forward a few years. Here I am, typing this post, anxiously waiting while being hyped as hell for the new upcoming Pokemon games in the holiday of 2016. These were announced yesterday, in the Pokemon Direct that was held by Junichi Masuda, the CEO of Pokemon. The main other thing that was announced was that the original games, Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow are being released on the Nintendo E-Shop for the 3DS. They retail at $12.49 CAD, which is actually much cheaper than I imagined it to be. I'll end up getting those games within the next week or so, and seeing that I have never played those games, I'm pretty darn excited.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm playing through X and Y once more, but with a twist. I'm doing something called a Nuzlocke challenge, and if you do not know what that is, it's basically a more challenging version of the regular game. There are 3 rules, and they are that you may only catch the first Pokemon in each route, fainted Pokemon are treated as dead, and you must nickname every Pokemon you get. What ends up happening is that you must be extremely careful with how you play, as a "white-out" is considered as a game over.</p>

<p>I hope that at least some of you are as pumped as me for the upcoming Pokemon Sun and Moon games, and I seriously hope they come the sooner part of the holiday. That's it for today, until our next encounter (see what I did there?) - ciao!</p>

      <p><p>Alright, first off I'M SORRY :( I know I said would post about the new Star Wars movies but I never really did. It's been 1.5 months since I first watched the movie, and I think it's high time I do a formal-esque review. Let me start off with a bit of a background on when I watched the original movies. When I first watched them, I absolutely fell in love with them. I swung mop sticks around the house, made lightsaber noises with my house, and did everything a kid in love with Star Wars would do. I always found myself loving the whole Star Wars theme, and this is even prominent today. In fact, quite recently I spent about 50 hours editing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nJ55_RCwvw" title="Title">this video.</a></p>

<p>So on to the actual movie. The movie was freaking amazing. I loved every second of it, and like I said in my Spectre post, it was quite nostalgic for me. I loved the way they did the film, in the way that the mixed the plot of the original movies with a brand new one. For those who haven't watched the movie as of yet, I suggest you do not read the remainder of this post as there might be possible spoilers.</p>

<p>Still with me? Alright, so I like what they did with Rey, and how she reminds me of Luke in the 4th movie. Both lived on a desert planet, was the so-called "underdog" of the film. The action in the movie was that of a classic Star Wars movie - lasers flying everywhere, a couple lightsaber fights (although more like 1 main one), and a lot of emotion. Perhaps the last one was not so much of a classic Star Wars trait. There were also a lot of subtle hints throughout, such as the "broken" looking lightsaber belonging to Kylo Ren, the small cutscenes of Rey's family, and how we see the Force slowly develop in Rey thorughout the movie.</p>

<p>Now moving on to if it's worth watching. My personal take: HELL YES. GO WATCH IT. What I would recommend however, is that you watch the original movies first (only the 4th, 5th, and 6th count). It allows you to see many more context clues, and see exactly why the characters acted the way they did throughout. I know I'm not the best person at reviewing movies, but I like to think of my reviews more as experiences. However my personal review: 9/10. As much as the movie was great, there were places they could improve on such as the overall redundancy between the original movies and the new trilogy, such as the pub, Rey's home planet, etc. One could consider these as good things, but they can be interpreted both ways. I guess that,s it, until next time - may the force be with you!</p>

      <p><p>Recently, I've been looking into setting up e-mail notifications for this blog (soon to come, I promise), and it's been difficult setting up a script to send out emails. I initially looked at sending email's through terminal using a service called postfix, but that went way above my head and I didn't know what was going on. I spend about 8 hours looking at a billion different ways to do this. Finally, after endless searching, I managed to do it. I ended up using python, and I was surprised on how easy it was. It took me ~10 minutes to set it up once I knew how to, much less than the amount of time I spend on trying to do it through terminal.</p>

<p>So how exactly did I do it? The code is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import smtplib
from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.MIMEText import MIMEText
from email.MIMEBase import MIMEBase
from email import encoders

#Credentials
credFile = open('creds.txt')
password = credFile.readline()

#Mailing list - add users here
mailingList = ['email1', 'email2']
fromaddr = 'youremail@domain.com'

msg = MIMEMultipart()

#Open post
post = open("post.txt") #Used to send preview of post to followers
body = ""
counter = 1
for line in post.readline():
    if counter &gt; 300 and line == ".":
        body += line
        break #Terrible programming practice I know
    body += line

msg['From'] = fromaddr

#Send email to each person in the mailinglist
for toaddr in mailingList:
    msg['To'] = toaddr
    msg['Subject'] = "The Ultimate Switch"

    body = body + "\nRead More at nostack.github.io :)"

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login(fromaddr, password)
    text = msg.as_string()
    server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text)
    server.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! I hope this would help you in the future :) Until next time - ciao!</p>

      <p><p>So when I say the ultimate switch, what exactly do I mean? Most people growing up used to play with toys, or watch endless hours of Treehouse, or do something of the sort. My childhood was a lot different, partly because I grew up with a brother who was 8 years older than me. I always fancied the things he did, such as making powerpoint presentations, or playing Doom on the computer, etc. As soon as he used to finish up with the computer, I used to hop on it and do exactly what he did. Due to this, I grew up with computers. I always used Windows computers, as those were the ones we had around the house. So for about 10 years of my life (the time that I used computers), I was used to Windows PCs. But then, perhaps last month, I found out that my brother was going to switch jobs and join a startup. I was always envious of the things he had, especially his Macbook. I think you can see where this is going. When he told me that he would get a computer from his new job and wouldn't need his Mac, I was excited. He told me that I would get his Mac, and I was astonished. It was always my dream to get a unix machine, due to the sheer power of the OS. The beauty of the OS doesn't hurt either.</p>

<p>Now comes the part of the ultimate switch. It's been about a week since I made the switch to a Mac, and I'm absolutely loving it. I love being able to use the power of git and the power of ruby all within the same terminal. I no longer have to open one terminal for git, and another for everything else. It's not that I don't use my old laptop anymore, I just use that for other purposes instead. I now use my old Lenovo for gaming, and I use the Mac for all my work (school-related and everything else).</p>

<p>The advantages of this are two-fold. First, I'm able to rid myself of any distraction while I'm doing school work, as well as be able to do many things I couldn't do before. Before I got the Macbook, I was having serious issues with my laptop. The power port constantly kept going inside, which meant I had to constantly readjust the port, wasting lots of time. Secondly, I over the course of the 1.5 years I owned this laptop, I had to send it for repair 3 times. Each time I sent it in, I had to waste about 2 months. This meant that in the 18 months I had the laptop, I only had it for 12.</p>

<p>Now that I have less distractions, I'm now able to focus on things I couldn't do before. I'm now able to actually be able to get into Android Development, something that I was never able to focus on before. I finished my first course on it yesterday, and I'm very proud of myself due to that. I'm now taking a new course, the "Developing Android Apps" course by Google on Udacity. I'll look into setting up Android Studio with Github, so in case you're interested, you can look into what exactly I'm doing. That's it for now - sayonara!</p>

      <p><p>So recently, about 2 months ago, I mentioned that I had quit Dota 2 and switched to doing more productive things, specifically code-related work. I have an update on that, however it needs a bit of a preface. Everyone in this world of ours gets angry from time, whether it be at a person, at the world, or even at yourself. However, not many people can simply bottle up that anger and hide it deep within themselves, and those who can still have trouble with it. It's not just anger, it can be any emotion such as sadness, frustration, fear, etc. The important thing is that you find a way to release this emotion, or rather find an outlet to deal with it.</p>

<p>According to dictionary.com, an outlet is "a means of expression or satisfaction". It basically is a way to express yourself, and in this case it is a way to deal with your emotions. As a teenager, I have to deal with my emotions often, as I'm in that stage where my emotions are all over the place. For some people, their outlet is writing, or perhaps playing sports, or even simply talking to someone. I guess this blog is an outlet in a way, because I'm expressing my emotions and thoughts to the reader. These past few months, my emotions have been crazier than ever. I get annoyed at the smallest of things, from a simple thing like my parents telling me get off my pc, to a insignificant thing like losing a mark on my test.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had an epiphany. Ever since I reduced my gaming time, I've been facing this more and more. Don't get me wrong, Dota 2 only aggravated my emotions. However, recently I've been increasing my playtime of games like Maplestory and other MMORPGs. Playing as a character, one that you designed, is pretty awesome for getting away from the chaos happening inside yourself. It's like reading a book, getting completely losing yourself inside it, losing touch of reality and being completely engrossed inside it. Sure, gaming can be considered counter-productive to basically anything, but in regulation, it can really help you.</p>

<p>Now moving on to the exact games I play. As of this moment, I have about 100 games in my steam library, 94 are my brother's which he shared with me, and the rest are mine. I've been playing a lot of Witcher 3 + CS:GO, and I really like it. This brings me to my next point - the future of this blog. At the moment, I'm trying to get an audio version of this blog setup - a way that readers can choose to listen to the post (me talking) or read it themselves. I also want to start doing more reviews, specifically movies, games, and even books from time to time.</p>

<p>In summary, find an outlet. Do something to release all those built up emotions inside you, don't ignore them. Until next time - au revoir!</p>

      <p><p>Recently, I went for the movie Spectre with one of my good friends. Spectre is your classic James Bond movie, with girls, action, and your classic villain. However, with Spectre, there's a twist. I won't expain the twist, as it makes this post suspectible to spoliers, but I'll say that the villain, or "organization", was originally introduced in Dr. No, the first James Bond movie. This reveals the sense of countuity throughout all the James Bond movies, as there is also a villain that is prominent in addition to the hero.  The movie was quite nostalgic for me, as I felt I hadn't watched a James Bond movie for ages, when realllyit had been less than two years. Growing up, most people would have watched Dora, or shows similar to that. With me however, Star Wars and James Bond was my childhood. I loved those classic car chases like the one in DIe Another Day, with James Bond in the classic Aston Martin.</p>

<p>Moving on to the actual movie, which was quite good. However, the one part I wish that was better were the expressions of Daniel Craig. He, by nature, is very expressionless, always being quite serious. It ruins the experience, as even during the romantic parts he seems like he is fighting a war. Due to this however, he does make a damn good James Bond, taking it quite seriously, unlike some of the other James Bonds. Roger Moore made 007 seem like a joke, using gadgets and tricks to make everything seem easy. Daniel Craig makes everything seem like a challenge, which is an aspect needed in a spy movie, but he needs to take it down a notch in certain places. On the flip side, there were many great things about the movie as well. I loved the new quartermaster (even though he was in Skyfall), I liked how in this movie he played a greater role than just the "gadget guy".  Secondly, I loved that the gadgets in the movie were much more subtle, with small uses rather than the prominent ones that save James Bond. I won't say more about the movie, as I think I've spoiled enough already.</p>

<p>I went to the movie in IMAX, and I loved it. I was originally debating between UltraAVX and IMAX, but in the end we decided to go to IMAX.  It was worth the amount of paid, which at the time, I thought was a hell lot (at the time being about 2 weeks ago). However, after watching the movie in IMAX, I can't imagine what it would have been like watching it in regular, as the sounds were one of the best parts of the movie.  Everytime there was an explosion, or a fight sequence, my ears would ring due to the immense sound.</p>

<p>All in all, I loved the experience as it had been a while since I had actually gone for a movie, the last one being Inside Out, which was a month or so after it came out, so not that long ago, but enough to make me forget. Nostalgia hit me hard, especially with that original introduction, when Daniel Craig walks in and shoots in front of him (It's hard to explain, I apologize).  The next movie on my list, rather the next one I'll write about which is even more nostalgic is the upcoming Star Wars Movie. Until next time, sayonara!</p>

      <p><p>Recently, I got back into programming, as mentioned in my last post. Although I like programming in python, I sometimes, well often, feel the restraints of python as a language, especially when it comes to defining variables and setting datatypes. For those don't understand what I mean, python dynamically sets the data types of variables, lists, subprograms, etc. Additionally, other languages like Java and C++ were designed with one specific purpose: Object-Oriented Programming. OOP isn't really possible in Python, and here started my journey to learn a new language.</p>

<p>Once I made the decision to learn a new language, I found myself at yet another crossroad. I had two choices, or rather two languages that I had to pick from to learn; Java and C++. I had learnt C++ back when I was in grade 7 or 8, and it's one of the languages whose syntax is quite easy to forget. However, I did recognize pieces of it, as a good friend of mine programs mostly in C++, in addition to Python. I finally made the decision to try something new, something different than what I was used to, Java. I currently am taking grade 11 computer science in high school, although I am in grade 10, and I often regret the fact that I didn't take grade 12, as I find the topics we learn too easy at times. Java is taught to the grade 12's, so I figured it would only be fitting to learn Java.</p>

<p>I started to learn Java, and found that the syntax was surprisingly similar, and almost instantly got to advanced topics like OOP, as most of the logical reasoning and syntax were quite easy to pick up, thanks to both the course I was taking as well as my previous endevours in C++. So once I started learning OOP, I decided I need a challenge, something to program as a way of demonstrating my newfound knowledge. I couldn't think of anything at that moment, so I decided to sleep on it, and perhaps decide the next day. At school, a friend of mine (as you can see friends often inspire me) actually told me that he was programming a monopoly game using OOP!</p>

<p>This is the place where I got an idea, a wonderful idea (in my opinion). I figured that it would be fun for him and I to code the program seperately, the same one, and then reconvene and see how each one did it, and how differently. So I started programming, using a seperate class for the people in the game, and within that having methods for a turn, such as rolling a dice and buying/selling properties, etc. This is where I ran into my first problem, how to actually store all the information of the spaces, or each property/airport/wildcard etc. Do I use a text file to import my data from, use arrays, how? I am yet to find a solution to this problem, and I probably will, but for now the project is on a full stop until I get through this week of school, as I have tests upon tests, mid term practicals and quizzes, etc.</p>

<p>Update Number 1: I have decided to put my monopoly project on hold while I put time aside to learn andoid dev. I am also overwhelmed with school at the moment, so I don't have much time for any extra activities. Sorry :-(</p>

<p>I'll keep you guys or gals, updated on both my solution, as well as future problems and interesting endevours I have. Until then, sayonara!</p>

      <p><p>When I was in grade 8, I stumbled upon a game called Dota 2. At the time, I didn't know what it was, or what the game was about, but I was excited to try the game that I had heard so much about. For those who don't know what Dota 2 is, it is basically a game in which you defend towers, but attack the other team's towers, eventually reaching the heart of their base, their ancient. It is a game similar to League of Legends, and it a real time strategy game, an RTS. However, this game in paticular is a lot harder than others (although this is up for debate), but is also quite addictive.</p>

<p>So in the summer of grade 8, I started to play this game with a friend of mine. We played every day pretty much, having fun, even though we died constantly and were terrible at the game. At one point however, we started to get better and learn from our mistakes. We watched the professionals play and we started to improve, but this is where things started to go downhill. We started to get annoyed at others, because they made the same mistakes we did when we started, but instead they were much more "salty", rather aggravating. Every two seconds I would find myself saying "Oh mon dieux" or something worse along those lines. Come grade 9, we continued to play this game, with newly found friends and new strategies.</p>

<p>However at one point, it got too much for my friend and I. We quit Dota 2 for a while, for about a stretch of 3 months, just until after exams. We found ourselves feeling much better every day, not getting annoyed at people, coding more, etc. I found myself playing other games, like Maplestory, Planetside 2, etc. At the time, gaming was my outlet, where I could let go of all my built up emotions and just be someone else entierly.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the summer of grade 9, and I found myself at a crossroad. I liked playing Dota, but I also found myself hating it at times. My choice was to either stop playing Dota to find myself eventually coming back to it, or continue playing it and not do anything productive. If you know me, you know I don't like two choices. I made a third choice, and I gave up gaming entierly, for the most part at least. I started learning HTML and CSS, using the command line (which is what is used to run this blog), as well as learning other languages and being more productive.</p>

<p>So what's my point in all this? Am I trying to say gaming is bad? No, actually it is the opposite. What I'm trying to say is always reflect on what you are doing, and make sure you are doing the thing that you truly wish you could be doing. I know this may sound, cheesy, and I often make things cheesy, but I'm dead serious. Even today, I rarely play video games, apart from the occasional jump on Maplestory maybe 3 times a week for about a half hour, from my 2 hour gaming sessions of Dota 2 every day. I now make time to write this blog, work on problems for Computer Science, etc. So that's it for this rant about my life and how gaming affected it, but I hope you took something from this, or if you didn't, I hope you learned something about me from this.</p>

      <p><p>This past weekend, something changed in my views of who I am. It all started when I went to the mall to buy a couple jackets for myself. I went to the GAP, and I couldn't really find anything in the kids section, the place I had shopped at for so long due to my height and body structure. I am quite thin, and am also relatively small for my age. So I decided to look in the men's section, a place where the sizes never fit me. I tried on the extra small, and it fit me! I felt so glad, as I always wanted to shop in the men's section for its better variety and choices. I bought the jackets I liked, and when I got home I didn't feel like an adolescent any more. Believe it or not, I felt a lot more mature. This shows how the tiniest change to attire can change the way you think about yourself and act with others. That's my story, hope you have gone through something like this as well!</p>

      <p><p>Hello people of the internet! I'm your host, PK! If you are on this webpage, you either are a friend who I mentioned this to, a person who typed in a wrong link and got here, or a web crawler. Either ways, hi! This is my first post on this blog-esque thing, and it is probably going to be an introductory post on what is going to be posted here. So here goes. On this page, you would find my adventures in programming, life rants, all types of reviews, and epiphany moments.</p>

<p>That is just a short outlook on what would be featured here, so the only way to find out more is to stay tuned (eventhough it isn't a channel/video)! Anyways, I'll see you soon!</p>
