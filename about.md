I'm Pranav Krishnan, but you can call me PK. I am a web developer, programmer in training, and infinitely more. I also am a high school student, intersted in photography, graphic design, computer programmer, and just about anything pertaining to computers.

I enjoy working on anything science-y, as well as participating in debates and arguments (half my friends say there's no poin in arguing with me because I'll win). I also enjoy doing lots of other things, but the list is too long to describe here, so if you want to read more about me, read my blog posts!
